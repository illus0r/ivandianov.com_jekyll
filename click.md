title: The Click project
---

The project focuses on how easily one assigns meaning to seemingly random combinations of blocks, giving them a personality and creating emotional connections.

I was inspired by Ringers in which people see animals and other characters. I wanted to amplify that quality, and the idea of constructing sculptures from blocks came to me when I was away from the computer, camping on the bank of a small river. It clicked! Endless combinations, fun characters, and me with a passion for cubes, voxels, and modular systems!

The sculptures are computed on both CPU and GPU: the positions, sizes and colors of blocks are calculated on CPU and then passed to GPU as a texture. I use technique of hybrid voxel raymarching so we can say the sculptures are made of colored void in a reflected space.

It is possible to fabricate all of the objects in real life. Combinations may seem impossible, due to the lack of perspective, but sooner or later it all clicks! It helps to keep in mind that all shapes are symmetrical.

The script uses modern features of GPU so it's supposed to work only on desktop: Chrome, Firefox or Safari
