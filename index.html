  <p>My name is Ivan Dianov [ī-və-n dē-ˈä-(ˌ)nōv], I explore complexity by writing code.</p>
  </section>  
  <p>There are processes, such as the climate change or the development of a human body, in which simple interactions of pieces lead to complex and unpredictable behavior of the system as a whole.</p>
  <p>Computer simulation allows us to handle complexity, tweak parameters and observe the surprising patterns that emerge. I'm obsessed with writing code and experimenting with multi-agent systems, cellular automata, and generative grammars.</br>
  I also use bugs in my code to create artistic effects. The bug is a symbol of the complexity of the world and of the limited consciousness of a human being. Our world is made up of countless mistakes, layered on top of each other. Even evolution is all about DNA replication errors.</p>
  <p>The whole world has gone wrong and will continue to move unpredictably. It is not to be resisted, it is to be enjoyed.
