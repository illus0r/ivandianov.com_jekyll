title: About Ivan



---

My name is Ivan Dianov [eye-van dee-ah-nev], I explore complexity by writing code.

There are processes, such as the climate change or the development of a human body, in which simple interactions of pieces lead to complex and unpredictable behavior of the system as a whole.


Computer simulation allows us to handle complexity, tweak parameters and observe the surprising patterns that emerge. I'm obsessed with writing code and experimenting with multi-agent systems, cellular automata, and generative grammars.


I also use bugs in my code to create artistic effects. The bug is a symbol of the complexity of the world and of the limited consciousness of a human being. Our world is made up of countless mistakes, layered on top of each other. Even evolution is all about DNA replication errors.


The whole world has gone wrong and will continue to move unpredictably. It is not to be resisted, it is to be enjoyed.
